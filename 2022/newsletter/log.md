# 2022 `newsletter` log 

DevX teammates logging events in anticipation for the next `newsletter`. To add an entry, just add an H2 header starting with the ISO 8601 format, a topic. 
**This log should be in reverse chronological order.**

When a newsletter is published, create a new entry with a H1, named "current" and rename the previous H1 to the date at which the newsletter was sent.

# Current
