# 2022 general `sg` hacking log

DevX teammates hacking on `sg` log. To add an entry, just add an H2 header starting with the ISO 8601 format, a topic.

## 2022-03-22 `sg [...] open`

Idea brought up [Scratchpad - Improving engineering onboarding: tooling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NS_C3te-59P149LD_rrL1zcflNqqZOoSHVJfv8oPcqY/edit)

> we want to make the tools available discoverable

- added one for `sg ci` (https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/32857)
- we don’t have `sg monitoring` yet, and we don’t even know if we will continue using Grafana going forward
- not much else to add?
